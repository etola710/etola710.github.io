This is a project I did for MEC 560 Advanced Control Systems at Stony Brook University. This project involved using dynamic programming to have a mobile robot navigate a known maze.

## Value Growth
Here is the value growth output for the dynamic programming. The high values are penalized and the robot attempts to find the path with the lowest value.

## Obstacle Avoidance
Here is the output for a maze I created along with a robot navigating that maze. After all of the paths were explored, the robot navigates the maze following the trajectory with the lowest weights.
