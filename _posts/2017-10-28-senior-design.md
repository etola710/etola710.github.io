## Project Goals

The goal of this project was the development of an [underactuated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underactuation) robotic hand that was capbable of in hand manipulation. During the prototyping phase of the project it became apparent that in hand manipulation was a difficult research problem but, we were able to develop and underactuated hand with power grasping capabilties.
